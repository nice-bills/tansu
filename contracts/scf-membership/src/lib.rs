//! SCF Membership
//!
//! Members are verified members of the community. After verification,
//! the admin can add a member. A member is represented with a SEP-50 NFT.
//! This is a soulbound NFT which can only be clawed backed by an admin.
//!
//! Additional traits are defined following ERC-7496:
//! - SCF role,
//! - Neural Quorum Governance Score.
//!
//! We pull NQG score from the NQG contract itself. So only the role can be
//! set via this contract.
